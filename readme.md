# Zhaoqi's Summer 2017 Intern at Tencent
- So here is some code I wrote at Tencent. I deployed those code on the company's computer so everything I have here is experiemental and not the final version.
- The naming of soccer game prediction model is a mess, but I can explain it if you ask :)
- So for the soccer prediction model thing I basically have two variations of the same model, one for league games (club games) and one for cup games (national teams). Both variations can predict the win/draw/loss or the goal difference of a game.
- The method I used -- Naive Bayes Classifier -- has a huge limitation, which is all the features must be independent (or you are overfitting). Since I am taking AI class and very interested in taking other "learning" classes next semester I might improve on the model with more clever methods.
